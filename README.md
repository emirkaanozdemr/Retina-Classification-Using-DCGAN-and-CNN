# Retina-Classification-Using-DCGAN-and-CNN
In this project, I aim to develop a robust system to classify real and synthetic retina images using advanced machine learning. I will generate synthetic retina images from a single eye photo using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) and classify them with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
